# USBSeeSound
USB MiclocV2 for Android Proof of Concept. What this does is to allow a individual to detect a sound that is above a cutoff threshold and get the sounds
location relative to small microphone array location. This, with the assistance of an Android phone, allows the individual to get a gps coordinates and use Google Maps
API to drop a pin at the calculated sounds location. This pin is visible on Google Maps' top down view and also Google Maps' AR viewer. Allowing the individual to see in Augmented Realty the approximate origin of the sound via an Android phone.
